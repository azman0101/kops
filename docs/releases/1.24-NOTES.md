# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.19 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.25.

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.20 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.26.

* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).

* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in future versions of kOps.

* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.

* Support for Docker has been removed for Kubernetes 1.24+. See https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq
